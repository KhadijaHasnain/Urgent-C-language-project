I can provide you with a basic code structure and explanations for each step of your project. However, implementing the entire project would be quite extensive, so I'll give you a starting point and you can build upon it.

Let's start with an outline of the code structure for your mysync program:

mysync.h

c
Copy code
#ifndef MYSYNC_H
#define MYSYNC_H

// Define data structures and function prototypes here

#endif
mysync.c

c
Copy code
#include "mysync.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Command-line option parsing, directory validation, and option handling
    // Call functions to perform synchronization
    return 0;
}
file_utils.c

c
Copy code
#include "mysync.h"

// Implement functions to list files, store file information, and identify files for synchronization
option_parser.c

c
Copy code
#include "mysync.h"

// Implement functions to parse command-line options
makefile

make
Copy code
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -std=c11 -Wall -Werror

all: mysync

mysync: mysync.c file_utils.c option_parser.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o mysync mysync.c file_utils.c option_parser.c

clean:
	rm -f mysync
Now, let's briefly discuss how to implement each step:

In mysync.h, define data structures like FileInfo to store file information and function prototypes for various operations.

In mysync.c, implement the main function for option parsing and high-level program logic. Use getopt to handle command-line options.

In file_utils.c, implement functions to list files within directories, store file information in data structures, and identify files for synchronization. Use POSIX functions like opendir, readdir, and stat.

In option_parser.c, implement functions to parse the command-line options using getopt.

Create a Makefile to compile the program. Make sure it uses the C11 compiler with the required flags.

For each step from your project plan, implement the corresponding functionality in the appropriate source files.

I've provided a basic code structure to get you started. You'll need to fill in the details and write the specific code for each function and operation based on your project requirements. You can also include error handling and validation as needed.

This should give you a starting point, and you can progressively build your mysync program by implementing each step of your project plan. If you have specific questions or need assistance with a particular part of the project, feel free to ask.
